				<p>Open university atmosphere - mixed nationalities, personalities, sense of fashion, age, sexual orientation, and backgrounds. I had an opportunity to get along students from both public and private high schools and not only from locally but international level.
				Top notch professors. It was really a privilege to be taught, handled and challenged by different types of BU professors. We were given the opportunity to enlist and choose the professor that we like for a certain subject requirement for the curriculum. From young professors who are very enthusiastic and high spirited to the professor emeritus and the not so young but technologically savvy and modern type of professors that we have which I can say gave me the variety of learning and ideas which made me who I am today.</p>

				<p>The institute has a distinct home-like feel to it and you could almost smell the positive ambiance radiating from it.
					The facilities are high end and could actually meet the standards of any high-end school you could name.
					The mentors, as we preferably call them, are approachable and caring at times. They don't make you feel like you're at the bottom of the pit and all of them are very enthusiastic with what they're doing.</p>
